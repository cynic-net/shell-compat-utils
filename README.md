shell-compat-utils: Aids for Compatibility Testing of Scripts
==============================================================

This builds programs that can help with testing compatibility of scripts
written on GNU/Linux systems with MacOS and BSD. The top-level `Test`
script builds all code and adds symlinks to `bin/` for each program with a
name that reflects its version.

### Programs

* `bash3`: Bash version 3.2.48, from the [unofficial mirror Git
  repo][bash-un] commit `f3b6bd19` ("Imported from ../bash-3.2.48.tar.gz.")
  This is probably similar to the latest version of Bash available on
  MacOS, which never upgraded to Bash 4.x but instead switched the default
  user shell to Zsh.

* `apple/text_cmds/` supplies various BSD text-manipulation programs.
  According to the [Apple OSS releases][aossrel] page, MacOS 10.12 (2016,
  "Sierra") uses the version tagged `text_cmds-97`, which is what we use
  here. The programs we build from this are:
  * `sed`: The MacOS version of sed. Installed in `bin/macsed`.

Zsh is not included in this repo because most systems already have a
current version of Zsh. (On Debian, install this with `apt install zsh`.)

### Installation

Building with `./Test` will install the programs into the following directories in this repo:
- `bin/`: Programs with names distinguished from the standard system names,
   e.g. `bash3` and `macsed`.
- `macbin/`: Programs with the standard system names on the given system,
   e.g. `bash` and `sed`.

Which bin/ directory you want to use depends on how you're doing your
testing. `bin/` is more convenient for checking a command invocation,
and `macbin/` is more convenient for checking a script that invokes
other commands.

You have several options for using them:

1. In the project using these, add appropriate `â€¦/*bin` directory to the
   path used by your test code.

2. For "global" access for your user, in `~/.local/bin/`, symlink the
   program names to the programs in this project's `bin/` directory, or
   simply copy `bin/*` to `~/.local/bin/`.

3. For "global" access on the whole system, copy `bin/*` to
   `/usr/local/bin/` (or similar), and ensure that the permissions are set
   so that the files are world-readable and -executable.

In the latter two cases you do _not_ want to copy or symlink the contents
of `macbin/` as that will probably break normal scripts on your system.


Notes
-----

### Bash 3

The committed `y.tab.*` are buggy, so we `touch parse.y` to force them
to be regnerated. That causes `git status` constantly to indicate that
the files (or subodule) are changed, which is annoying so we mark them
with `git update-index --assume-unchanged` to suppress this. Keep this
in mind if you're forking of your own private version of Bash 3.
